Being a sports aficionado, I’ve always had the special interest in the numbers game and the math in general continues to fascinate me. My passion and skill revolve around - Breaking down and solving complex business problems using data. 

I’ve cultivated this skill right from my undergraduate days. While the curriculum in Mathematics exposed me to intricacies of calculus and statistical concepts, my learnings in Electronics and Communication courses were supplemented with intensive programming opportunities. One of the projects in my final year at BITS Pilani involved extensive programming in MATLAB and in-depth statistical and regression analysis of experimental data. This was the first time I realized the real power of data which inculcated in me a deep interest for data analysis. This very interest provoked me to take a step further and do a specialization program in Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence which was offered by IIIT Bengaluru. This program provided me the platform where I could kick start a career in ML/Deep learning/NLP related areas.
